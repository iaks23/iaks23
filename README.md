# >> Hello Everyone! üëã  ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á üôèüèª

I'm Akshaya, a Data Science student at University of Technology, Sydney.  

As an aspiring Data Scientist, I want to be able to alter the voluminous amount of scattered data around us into meaningful information, find patterns and 
make predictions that could possibly change our lives, someday. 

My ultimate dream in life is to use AI for good; I want to create solutions that benefit the society and leave a lasting impact.
