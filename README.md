# >> Hello Everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Akshaya, a Data Science student interested in applying my learnings to tackle real world problems. 

As an aspiring Data Scientist, I want to be able to alter the voluminous amount of scattered data around us into meaningful information, find patterns and 
make predictions that could possibly change our lives, someday. 
I am always up for a quick chat about interesting findings in the field, 
so feel free to drop me a message on,
